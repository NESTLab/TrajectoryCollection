*** INTRODUCTION ***

In this package you'll find some basic examples to start using ARGoS.

To run an experiment with ARGoS, you need to define two things:
1. the robot controllers
2. the experiment configuration

You find example controllers in the controllers/ directory. The
experiment configuration files are located in the experiments/
directory.



*** COMPILATION ***

In principle, you can compile your code however you want. In practice,
the help of a build system makes your work much easier. In ARGoS, and
in these examples, we use CMake. To compile the examples, open up a
shell, go to the directory where you unpacked the tar.bz2 file and
type:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build

To produce debuggable code (slow), type:

$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..

To produce fast but not debuggable code, type:

$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

Finally, launch the compilation with the command:

$ make

If you find no error, you're ready to go to the next phase.



*** TROUBLESHOOTING ***

When you launch one of the two 'cmake' commands, you might get an
error like 'package argos3_simulator' not found. This error has two
possible causes:

1. You haven't installed ARGoS3 system-wide. To fix this, install
   ARGoS3 through the packages or with the command 'sudo make install'
   in the ARGoS3 build directory.

2. pkg-config can't find the file argos3_simulator.pc. When you
   install ARGoS3 from a package, this file is located in
   /usr/lib/pkgconfig/. When you install ARGoS3 from the sources, this
   file is located in $CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig/. If you
   don't set $CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX explicitly before compiling, by
   default it is set to /usr/local.  If the file is present and
   pkg-config can't find it, add the directory where it's located to
   the environment variable PKG_CONFIG_PATH, e.g.

$ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/



*** RUNNING THE EXAMPLES ***

To run an example, the configuration files have been written with the
hypothesis that you run them in the directory where you unpacked the
tar.bz2, NOT in the build/ directory. Therefore, go to that directory
and type:

for the example obstacle avoidance with 10 robots,

$ argos3 -c experiments/flocking.argos

for the flocking experiment, and

$ argos3 -c experiments/foraging.argos

for the foraging experiment.
